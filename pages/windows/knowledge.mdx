## `.items()` or `slots` empty or null
The items of a window may not be sent when the window is opened, and may instead be sent by the server after the window is opened. This meaning you may need to just add a delay before interacting with the window. 
```js copy
bot.on('windowOpen', async function(window) {
  await bot.waitForTicks(20); // 20 ticks is 1 second, delay may depend on server
  // Interact with window
})

```

## requiresConfirmation
If you get an error like these, it simply means your interaction wasn't successful, or in most cases "as intended". On servers where you use a "fake" inventory as a server selector for example, your interaction is actually cancelled ("rejected") but the server does this so you can't take items out of inventories you shouldn't be able to. All you need to do is change `window.requiresConfirmation` to your window interaction.
```
Error: Server didn't respond to transaction for clicking on slot ${slot} on window with id ${window?.id}.
Error: Server rejected transaction for clicking on slot {slot}, on window with id ${window?.id}.
```

```js copy
bot.on('windowOpen', function() {
  window.requiresConfirmation = false;
  // Add code
})
```
