# Introduction to Windows (Containers)

## Windows
In the case of mineflayer, a `window` is an Object from the [prismarine-window](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/prismarine-windows) module used to represent Minecraft windows. This [API](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/prismarine-windows/blob/master/API.md) provides a way to interact with those windows.


<p>The simplest way of accessing an opened window would be to listen to the `windowOpen` event, where the window is passed as an argumet. This event is fired every time a window is opened.</p>
```js
bot.on('windowOpen', function(window) {

});
```
